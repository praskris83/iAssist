# NearbyBackground Sample App for iOS

This is a sample app for third party developers using the Nearby Messages library. It shares your
presence (as an anonymous name) with nearby devices, and displays names from nearby devices.  It
continues to work in the background using BLE; it uses audio only in the foreground.
